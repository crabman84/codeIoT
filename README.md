*IoT Project folder for differnet IoT projects* 

To Dos: 
- Send full array of data to rPi 
- make sure power supply is stable
	- maybe add a capacitor in parralel with  motor?


Problems with code and hardware:
- 'with dbConn:' is Deprecated 
- raspberry pi cannot handle powering arduino with servo motor. Needed to add sepearete power supply over power jack
-
